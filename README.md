# NIPS Implementation Challenge 2017- Deep Sets

This repository is for [Nurture AI's Global NIPS Implementation Challenge](https://nurture.ai/nips-challenge). I have tried to implement NIPS 2017's [Deep Sets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6931-deep-sets) paper. 









# Acknowlegements
I would like to thank [Nurture AI](https://nurture.ai/) for this amazing initiative, and mentor [Brian Cheung](https://github.com/briancheung) for his guidance, without which this would not have been possible.
